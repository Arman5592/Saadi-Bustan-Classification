# Saadi-Bustan-Classification

A notebook that explores the classification of [Saadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Shirazi)'s poems' couplets between 10 classes (chapters of Bustan). Saadi was a Persian poet from the 13th century whose work gained fame for its moral themes. As part of the [advanced information retrieval course](https://language.ml/) we explored a classification problem on his work.

This notebook (in Farsi) extracts Saadi's Bustan from raw data, performs customized pre-processing procedures, and attempts to classify them using logistic regression, a Persian BERT-based model, and a neural network using TorchText. Additionally, we examined a model's features, experimented with isolation forests to detect outliers (non-Saadi couplets), and performed dataset augmentation.
